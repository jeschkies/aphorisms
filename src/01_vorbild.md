# Leadership means Vorbild

When you think about someone showing leadership think about this person as a role model.

It took me almost ten years to get behind the leadership mentality I've found most often in the US. In my high school
year abroad students were urged to show leadership. At Amazon we were presented "Leadership Principles". At my current job
engineers are praised for their leadership.

As a German the term leadership makes one uneasy due to our history. I sometimes joked that not everyone can be a
leader because they would be left without followers. When I was in a sarcastic mood I'd translate "leader" to "Führer":
"Be a Führer for your team!", "Bob is a real Führer". I hope you have the same hard time with this translation as I do.

My translation was not the proper *interpretation*, though. It should be "Vorbild", role model. When someone shows
leadership that person leads by example. Being a leader means to act like one expects everyone else to act as well.

[Richard Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Winters) is considered by some a great leader. In episode 5 of
the mini-series Band of Brothers he is depicted to literally lead the charge. He shows his man what he's expecting by
doing it before anyone else does. He's leading by example.

In 1914 [Ernest Shackleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton) was trapped along side twentyseven in the
artic ice. They had lost their ship and little hope of return was left. Alfred Lansing describes in his
[book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance:_Shackleton%27s_Incredible_Voyage) Shackleton as the one who never showed
despair in front of his men. This lifted their spirits and they followed suite.
