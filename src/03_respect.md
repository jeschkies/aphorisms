# Respect What Came Before

Always respect the work and decisions others made before you. Assume they had more knowledge and were smarter than you
are now.

Very often we engineers are confronted with seemingly strange code and design decisions by the ones who came before us.
We have a hard time understanding the library's interface, the pattern, the architecture. We jump to conclusions and
more often want a rewrite only to find out that things are not so simple. We find edge cases we did not think about
before. We are constraint by legacy systems. Sometimes, we hit the [wall of math](https://www.memsql.com/blog/cache-is-the-new-ram/).

So before doing anything else we should try to come up with reasons that would have made us write the same strange code
or make the same strange design decisions. Only once we succeeded and made the case *for* the ones who came before we
are allowed to judge. Only then are we allowed to propose an alternative. I gurantee that we will more often than not
fail to come up with a better solution.

explanation is my poor interpretation.
