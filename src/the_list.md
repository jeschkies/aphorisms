# Engineering Aphorisms

## Introduction

This is a list of aphorisms inspired by Amazon's [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles),
[The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), Marathon's [Code Culture](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/docs/docs/code-culture.md),
Basecamp's [Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) and others I failed to find again.

The list serves me as an everyday reminder in my engineering life. It is in no particular order except for the first two
items. Feel free to suggest improvements by filing a [pull request](https://github.com/jeschkies/aphorisms/compare?expand=1).

1. [Leadership Means Vorbild](./01_vorbild.md)
2. [Assume Best Intentions, Always](./02_best_intentions.md)
3. Respect What Came Before
4. Fail Loud and Proud
5. Let it Crash
6. Slow and Steady over Fast and Uncontrollable
7. Iterate and Learn
8. Celebrate Success Not Failure
9. I Am Not Smart
