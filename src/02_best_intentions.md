# Assume Best Intentions, Always

Always assume that the person you are working with has the best intentions for the project you are working on.

This should be almost a trivial statement. If we do not assume that our co-workers have the best intentions we have to
assume they do not care about the project at best. Why would we then want to work with them? How would we work with
them? It does not add up.

Let's be honest. There are cases when we are upset about something someone else did. Me might judge the code change,
email or comment by the other as malicious. Since we assume best intentions, though, we have to dig deeper and wonder
*why* the code change is this way, *how* the email was really meant, *what* the comment does say. Instead of pondering
over these questions we can simply ask the other side or a third party. We will be surprised.

There have been several cases in my work life when I was just flabbergasted by a code change or design decision. It just
did not add up for me and I became upset. So I asked. And found the really reason. Often one side was just missing someone
important information. Asking why, how or what instead of shortcutting to a conclusion also surfaces information for
everyone else involved.

So, just be nice to each other, I guess.
